# nvidia-numba-basics

This is my play area for CUDA programming in Python using the Numba library [https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/cuda/index.html]

Nvidia's Deepp Learning Institute has this starter course [https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+S-AC-10+V1] which I would recommend to build foundational knowledge.

Caveat: CUDA programming doesn't fall into my core area of daily work, so these examples are for my own learning. I might revisit and update them as I get better.
